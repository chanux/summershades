*bsumm.net color bands for everyone.*


***It's not there yet!***

I have been to [bsumm.net](http://bsumm.net) several times through hackernews and every single time the color bands left me puzzled.

On one boring morning I found myself on bsumm.net and realized I still didn't know how those colors are connected to letters.

Then I went on an figured it out. I showed it to my colleagues and one wanted the color bands for her name too. Then I decided to make this.
